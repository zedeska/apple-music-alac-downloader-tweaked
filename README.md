# Apple Music ALAC Downloader
Original script by Sorrow. Modified by alacleaker to include some fixes and improvements.

## How to use
1. Create a virtual device on Android Studio with a image that doesn't have Google APIs.
2. Install this version of Apple Music: https://www.apkmirror.com/apk/apple/apple-music/apple-music-3-6-0-beta-release/apple-music-3-6-0-beta-4-android-apk-download/. You will also need SAI to install it: https://f-droid.org/pt_BR/packages/com.aefyr.sai.fdroid/.
3. Launch Apple Music and sign in to your account. Subscription required.
4. Port forward 10020 TCP: `adb forward tcp:10020 tcp:10020`.
5. Start frida server.
6. Start the frida agent: `frida -U -l agent.js -f com.apple.android.music`.
7. Start downloading some albums: `go run main.go https://music.apple.com/us/album/whenever-you-need-somebody-2022-remaster/1624945511`.

## Changes
Now only accept 1 url as the first argument, second is for folder name.

For exemple `o run main.go https://music.apple.com/us/album/whenever-you-need-somebody-2022-remaster/1624945511 rick-astley` will download the album in a "rick-astley" (instead of the default "AM-DL Download" one)
